# 🚀 Your Declarative macOS Setup is Ready!

## 📋 Current Status

**You asked**: "Is all now declaratively configured via Nix?"

**Answer**: **Not yet!** But I've prepared everything for you:

### What You Have Now:
- ❌ **Nix**: Not installed
- 📄 **Configs**: Still traditional dotfiles (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/*`)
- 🍺 **Homebrew**: Managing your apps traditionally

### What I've Created:
✅ Complete Nix configuration in `~/dev/Github/nix-config/`:
```
nix-config/
├── 🚀 bootstrap.sh      # One-command setup
├── ❄️  flake.nix        # Full system config
├── 📖 README.md         # Documentation
├── 🔄 migrate.sh        # Migration helper
├── 🔐 AWS Secrets integration!  # NEW!
└── modules/
    ├── 🍎 darwin.nix    # macOS + Homebrew
    └── 🏠 home.nix      # Your tools & configs
```

## 🆕 AWS Secrets Integration Added!

**YES!** The configuration now includes automatic AWS Secrets Manager integration:

✅ **Auto-loads `api-keys` secret** on shell startup
✅ **Exports all keys as environment variables** 
✅ **Excludes `GITHUB_TOKEN`** as you requested
✅ **Works in both zsh and nushell**
✅ **Shows status**: `✅ AWS secrets loaded: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, VOYAGE_API_KEY, ...`

## 🎯 To Make Everything Declarative

### Option 1: Full Migration (Recommended)
```bash
cd ~/dev/Github/nix-config
./bootstrap.sh
```

This will:
1. Install Nix package manager
2. Set up nix-darwin
3. Apply your entire configuration
4. Make ALL your configs declarative
5. **Automatically load AWS secrets in every shell**

### Option 2: Test First
```bash
# Just look at what would happen
cd ~/dev/Github/nix-config
cat ARCHITECTURE.md
cat AWS_SECRETS_INTEGRATION.md  # NEW!
cat modules/home.nix
```

## 🔄 What Changes

### Before (Now):
- Configs scattered in `~/.config/`
- Manual Homebrew management
- No version control for system settings
- Can't reproduce on new machine
- Manual AWS secrets management

### After (With Nix):
- Everything in one Git repo
- Declarative package management
- System settings as code
- One command to reproduce anywhere
- **Automatic AWS secrets loading**

## ⚡ The Magic Command

On a brand new Mac, you'll be able to:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR/nix-config/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

And get your ENTIRE environment - terminal, tools, apps, settings, **AND AWS secrets** - perfectly reproduced!

## 🤔 Should You Do It?

**YES, if you want:**
- ✅ Reproducible environments
- ✅ Version-controlled system config
- ✅ Easy machine migrations
- ✅ Atomic updates/rollbacks
- ✅ Automatic AWS secrets in all shells

**WAIT, if you:**
- ❌ Prefer manual control
- ❌ Don't switch machines often
- ❌ Happy with current setup

## 📍 Your Next Step

```bash
# Check what we've prepared
cd ~/dev/Github/nix-config
./status.sh

# Review AWS secrets integration
cat AWS_SECRETS_INTEGRATION.md

# When ready to migrate
./bootstrap.sh
```

**Remember**: Your current configs are safe! The migration script backs everything up first.
